## About the project
The aim of the project is to monitor key revenue metrics for a mobile game subscription-based business. By tracking these metrics, the dashboard helps identify trends that impact MRR and customer lifetime value, supporting data-driven decisions to optimize revenue and reduce churn.

## About the dataset
The dataset contains information about user revenue metrics for a mobile game, including user demographics (language, age), device type, and payment details. It tracks revenue generated by each user and their payment dates.

## Questions for the analysis
1. How has Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) changed over time, and what factors are driving these changes?
2. How many new paid users are joining each month, and how many are leaving?
3. What is the churn rate, and how much revenue is lost due to customer churn?
4. What is the average customer lifetime and lifetime value, and how is it trending?
5. Are there specific months or patterns where user acquisition or churn is noticeably higher or lower?

## Key takeaways
1. MRR peaks in September and October, indicating potential seasonal trends or influencing factors.
2. November experiences the highest churned revenue, highlighting a significant retention challenge.
3. Customer lifetime value is growing steadily, suggesting that long-term customers are becoming more valuable.
4. New users are consistently joining, but steady churn means addressing it could greatly enhance revenue.
5. Demographic filters provide insights that can inform targeted marketing and retention strategies.

## Recommendations
1. Focus on targeted campaigns during high-churn months to keep more customers.
2. Increase marketing initiatives in September and October to capitalize on peak MRR periods and drive more user acquisition.
3. Improve customer support and onboarding to enhance satisfaction and reduce churn.
4.  Regularly collect feedback to better understand customer needs and improve services.
5.  Use demographic data to create tailored marketing strategies that resonate with specific user segments.
